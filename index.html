      <h3 id="headline">Here is a basic summary of Luffy's life and his goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginning</strong> - Born in East Blue (said to be the weakest area of the One Piece world)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Family</strong> - His Granfather is one of the most famous Marines to Exist (Garp), while his father is the leader of the Revolutionaries. Safe to say this is a very dysfuctional family.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why he became a Pirate</strong> - Although Luffy had a granfather in he Marines, it was the appearance of Shanks, a world famous pirate, that inspired him to travel the seas. with his mind set at an early age, it was a matter of reaching the age of 17, where he was old enough to fend for himself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Powers</strong> In the world of One Piece, there are cursed fruits that provide powers and also make the user lose his/her abilty to swim. Luffy took the "Gomu Gomu no Mi" fruit, which gives him the ability of rubber. He can deflect bullets and stretch his skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>End Goal</strong> Luffy is after the "One Piece", which is said to be the greatest treasure in the world and nobody currently has access to it. Luffy's goal is to claim it and in turn, become King of the Pirates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crew</strong> Unlike most pirates, building crews based on strength, Luffy built his crew on friendships and it really shows. These guys would fight with each other till the end.
        </li>
        
      </ul>
